# MIT 6.5840
## Dev
1. IDE: VsCode
2. Step
    1. `cd 6.5840-Dev`
    2. `code .`

## Note
1. For the convenience of development, develop in 6.5840-Dev. Test in 6.5840-Src.
2. Some parts have not been implemented yet, so in order to not affect the code completion of vscode go, I changed the suffix to `.Noah`
